Details\n\nThe current implementation has a URL redirection issue when users navigate from the Orders screen to Shipment Overview. The navigation creates a malformed URL with {{[object Object]}} instead of the proper query parameter {{ids=<Load Number>}}, which prevents critical fields like Booking Number and Bill of Lading from being displayed.\n\n*Current Broken Behavior:*\n\n* Navigation from Order Overview \u2192 Shipment Overview generates URL: {{https://app.fourkites.com/beta/loads/626934750?[object Object]}}\n* This malformed URL causes the frontend to fail in properly loading ocean service data\n* Backend ocean service API has the correct booking number data but it's not mapped/displayed in the UI\n\n*Expected Behavior:*\n\n* Navigation should generate proper URL: {{https://app.fourkites.com/beta/loads/626934750?ids=ONEU9162082}}\n* All shipment fields should display consistently regardless of navigation flow\n\n*Root Cause:*\n\n* Orders screen is incorrectly constructing the redirect URL query parameters\n* Object is being passed where a string parameter is expected\n* Frontend is not handling this gracefully and fails to load required data\n\n*Business Impact:*\n\n* *VVIP Customer Impact:* Blocking Tyson's end-user rollout (Implementation blocker)\n* Loss of critical freight documentation visibility for users\n* Inconsistent user experience creates confusion and support burden\n* Affects both Booking Number and Bill of Lading fields (potentially other fields as well)\n\n*Affected Customers:*\n\n* Tyson Foods (VVIP - Implementation Blocker)\n* Potentially all customers using Order-to-Shipment navigation flow",

      "description": "Hi Team,\n\n*Shipper:* Louis Dreyfus Company (LDC)\n*Example Load:* ONEYTAOFL2320900\n\n*Important Context*\nPlease note that LDC\u2019s pilot phase with FourKites is nearing completion. As part of this, they will be closely reviewing service performance before making a final subscription decision. The issue outlined below has raised concerns on data reliability.Issue Summary\nFor the above shipment (and several others), *Vessel Departure (VD)* was marked via an *inferred event* _before_ the vessel was actually loaded.\n\n* The *inferred VD* was marked on *12/02*\n* The *actual ERPA update* with VD was received later on *12/04*, after vessel loading\n* As a result, the customer sees VD occurring before the load event, which appears unrealistic and confusing\n\nAdditionally:\n\n* The inferred *Vessel Arrival (VA)* and *Vessel Departure (VD)* show a gap of only ~2 hours at port\n* LDC has questioned how a vessel can arrive and depart within such a short window, especially before loading is completed\n* This behavior has been observed across multiple shipments\n\nOne consistent pattern across the affected shipments:\n\n* All loads were *created on 12/23*\n* However, the *actual sailing dates were on or before 12/02*\n\nThis suggests that the system may be inferring VA/VD events retrospectively for historical sailings, possibly due to *late load creation (LLC)*. We need confirmation on whether this is the expected behavior and if LLC is the root cause.Customer Impact\n\n* Data appears unrealistic and inconsistent with actual vessel operations\n* Loss of confidence in inferred events and milestone accuracy\n* Risk to pilot success and final subscription decision\n\nAsk / Next Steps\n\n# Can you confirm whether *late load creation (LLC)* is causing these inferred VA/VD events to be backfilled incorrectly?\n# Is there a way to *suppress or adjust inferred VA/VD* when the sailing has already occurred before load creation?\n# What is the recommended *long-term fix* to prevent inferred VD being marked before actual vessel loading?\n# Guidance on *customer-facing explanation* would be helpful before we respond to LDC.\n\nAffected Shipments\n*Evergreen*\n\n* 159500040475\n* 159500036762\n* 159500048417\n* 159500048719\n* 159500048701\n* 159500048182\n* 159500040492\n* 159500042028\n\n*MSC*\n\n* 177WATATQ1998RF\n\n*ONE*\n\n* ONEYTAOFL2320900\n* ONEYTAOFL6937600\n* ONEYTAOFL5237500\n* ONEYTAOFL9184300\n* ONEYTAOFL5250700\n* ONEYTAOFK4728800\n* ONEYTAOFL6262400\n* TA5VYF673400\n* TA5DKM940800\n\nPlease let us know your findings and recommended next steps so we can respond to the customer with clarity and confidence.\n\n!Screenshot 2025-12-29 at 7.51.21\u202fAM.png|width=686,alt=\"Screenshot 2025-12-29 at 7.51.21\u202fAM.png\"!",

In the case of P&G, we have\ntwo platform entities that share external IDs for various carriers:\n\n* \"Procter & Gamble\" [perma: procter-gamble-north-america]\n* \"Procter & Gamble (Testing Environment)\" [perma:\n   procter-gamble-testing-environment]\n\n!image-20250925-061548.png|width=873,height=110,alt=\"image-20250925-061548.png\"!\n\n\n\n!image-20250925-061602.png|width=873,height=116,alt=\"image-20250925-061602.png\"!\n\n\n\nIn digging into P&G's timeliness metrics ahead of the governance call, I'm\nfinding that we are not processing EDI updates that are sent to us in a\ntimely manner and instead we're relying on RPA which for some reason is\nprocessing updates very late:\n\n!image-20250925-061631.png|width=1798,height=753,alt=\"image-20250925-061631.png\"!\n\n\n\nHapag sent us an in-gate event on 9/12 but it appears the updates was not\nprocessed because of the external ID issue. I'm not 100% sure if this\nmessage below means that we didn't process the update due to the shared\nexternal ID but I will raise a Support case to check.\n\n\n\n!image-20250925-061657.png|width=1401,height=353,alt=\"image-20250925-061657.png\"!\n\n\n\n2025-09-12 14:34:27.867, INFO - [e9d129cd369a] PRMS:\n{\"MessageType\"=>\"PROCESS_OCEAN_UPDATE\", \"Source\"=>\"superfile_ftp\",\n\"CarrierFileDetails\"=>{\"source\"=>\"superfile_ftp\",\n\"source_directory\"=>\"315_alt\",\n\"file_backup_path\"=>\"super_files/hapaglloyd/315's Hapag\nLloyd/2025-09-12/20250912141426-20250912140823-HLCU-884436\",\n\"file_name\"=>\"20250912140823-HLCU-884436\", \"file_received_time\"=>\"\n*2025-09-12T14:08:58.000Z*\", \"file_downloaded_time\"=>\"2025-09-12T14:14:26Z\",\n\"s3_file_name\"=>\"20250912141426-20250912140823-HLCU-884436\",\n\"file_uuid\"=>\"1532e437-24fe-4f6b-bdff-3aa89eefcba8\"},\n\"Content\"=>{\"Carrier\"=>\"hapaglloyd\", \"ExternalId\"=>\"884436\",\n\"ReceivedTime\"=>\"2025-09-12T14:14:26Z\",\n\"Shipper\"=>\"procter-gamble-north-america\",\n\"BillOfLading\"=>\"HLCUALY250906175\", \"PONumber\"=>nil,\n\"DataHash\"=>{\"reference_numbers\"=>[{\"type\"=>\"BN\", \"value\"=>\"29783780\"},\n{\"type\"=>\"SI\", \"value\"=>\"1014580527\"}, {\"type\"=>\"SN\",\n\"value\"=>\"HLC2539682\"}], \"po_numbers\"=>nil,\n\"alternate_external_id\"=>\"884436\", \"notification_date_time\"=>\"2025-09-12\n14:08:00\", \"edi_file_type\"=>\"315\", \"equipment_number\"=>\"FANU3082101\",\n\"ocean_container_number\"=>\"FANU3082101\", \"event_source\"=>\"superfile\",\n\"event_date_time\"=>\"2025-09-12 16:22:00\", \"update_type\"=>\"B4\",\n*\"update_action\"=>\"I\",* \"location_identity\"=>\"EGPSD\",\n\"equipment_status\"=>\"L\", \"container_type\"=>\"45G1\", \"event_timezone\"=>\"Local\nTimezone\", \"stop_type\"=>\"pickup\", \"scac\"=>\"HLCU\", \"purchase_order\"=>nil,\n\"bill_of_lading\"=>\"HLCUALY250906175\", \"vessel_code\"=>\"9386471\",\n\"vessel_name\"=>\"KASSIAKOS\", \"vessel_type\"=>\"L\", \"voyage_id\"=>\"537E\",\n\"commodity_info\"=>{\"lading_quantity\"=>\"\", \"weight\"=>\"23510\",\n\"weight_qualifier\"=>\"G\", \"volume\"=>\"\", \"volume_unit\"=>\"\",\n\"weight_unit\"=>\"K\"}, \"transshipment_ports\"=>nil, \"port_name\"=>\"PORT SAID\",\n\"country\"=>\"EG\", \"event_date_time_qualifier\"=>\"Actual\",\n\"contractual_place_of_receipt_code_R\"=>{\"port_name\"=>\"PORT SAID\",\n\"country\"=>\"EG\", \"location_identity\"=>\"EGPSD\",\n\"event_date_time_qualifier\"=>\"Estimated\", \"event_date_time\"=>\"2025-09-14\n21:00:00\", \"e\n\n\n\nBest regards,\n\nJohnny Mei ",

Details\n\nThis story extends the functionality implemented in MM-11875 to include Ship to and Customer Code fields to the following additional stop types:\n\n* *Place of Receipt*\n* *Place of Delivery*\n* *Origin Rail Terminal*\n* *Destination Rail Terminal*\n\nCurrently, these fields are available on carrier-created TSP (Transhipment Port) stops as per MM-11875. This enhancement ensures consistency across all stop types for comprehensive shipment tracking and addresses the business need for complete visibility throughout the shipping journey.\n\nh3. Business Impact & Critical Use Case\n\n*RCS Logistics Platform Access Issue:*\n\nRCS Logistics provides platform access to their end customers based on the \"Customer or Ship To\" code. Currently, since Place of Receipt, Place of Delivery, and Rail Terminal stops don't have these fields populated, *customers don't see these stops when they view shipments in the platform*. This creates significant visibility gaps:\n\n* Customers cannot track shipments at Place of Receipt\n* Customers lose visibility at Place of Delivery\n* Rail terminal movements are completely hidden from customer view\n* Customers must contact RCS support for information about these stop types\n* Creates perception of incomplete tracking capability\n\n*With this change:*\n\n* Customers get *full visibility to all their stops* based on their Customer/Ship To access\n* Platform access filtering works consistently across all stop types\n* Reduced support inquiries as customers can self-serve\n* Improved customer satisfaction and platform value perception\n* Enhanced competitive positioning for RCS Logistics\n\nh3. \n\nh3. Success Metrics\n\n* 100% of Place of Receipt, Place of Delivery, and Rail Terminal stops display customer/ship to codes\n* RCS Logistics customers report seeing all stop types that match their access credentials\n* Reduction in customer service inquiries from RCS Logistics end customers about missing stop visibility\n* Zero regression in existing stop type visibility",

The load started from an inland pickup and went to a rail terminal before going on a vessel.

While the carrier portal provided an implausible VD event dated 11/11 (before the 11/27 rail in-gate), this incorrect data was not ingested into our system. The root cause is that geofence-based auto-VD functionality appears to not be enabled for Smithfield, preventing the system from automatically updating the load status based on Spire location data that clearly indicates vessel departure from POL. This highlights a gap in handling scenarios where carrier milestone data is unreliable and automated fallback mechanisms need to compensate.\n\n*Screenshots:*\n\n!image-20260113-204848.png|width=669,alt=\"image-20260113-204848.png\"!\n\n!image-20260113-205651.png|width=669,alt=\"image-20260113-205651.png\"!\n\n!image-20260113-205713.png|width=669,alt=\"image-20260113-205713.png\"!\n\n\n\n*Referred Docs / Confluence links / Jira Tickets / Runbooks:*\n\n*Expected Result:* For the geofence to mark the vessel as arrived at POD\n\n*Actual Result:* Load is in \u2018at Port of Loading\u2019 status despite locations from spire near delivery",

Root Cause Analysis:\n\nThe issue occurs during the sync process from the STUCK_AT_POD records to the Unified Export table. Certain mandatory vessel-related fields (vessel name, vessel IMO, vessel MMSI) are missing in the STUCK_AT_POD data for affected loads, which prevents successful synchronization.\n\n*Why mandatory fields are missing:*\n\n* When Vessel Arrival (VA) updates for POD are received from carriers, vessels are correctly unassigned from loads\n* However, when VA for POD is triggered via geofence, vessels are NOT unassigned from loads\n* Without subsequent load non-status transition events, the vessel data remains incomplete in the sync message\n* This causes the Stuck at POD data to fail syncing to the Unified Export table\n\nh3. Current vs. Expected Behavior:\n\n*Current Behavior:*\n\n* Stuck at POD exceptions are calculated only for \"At Port of Discharge\" status in Unified Export\n* When VA is triggered by geofence, vessel data is not properly maintained\n* Scheduled exports show blank Stuck at POD column for affected loads\n\n*Expected Behavior:*\n\n* Stuck at POD exceptions should be calculated and synced for both \"At Port of Discharge\" AND \"Discharged\" statuses\n* Vessel data should be properly maintained regardless of how VA is triggered (carrier update or geofence)\n* Scheduled exports should consistently display Stuck at POD data showing number of days stuck\n\nh2. *Acceptance Criteria*\n\n# *Stuck at POD Exception Status Coverage*\n#* *Given* a load is at Port of Discharge or has been Discharged\n#* *When* the load has been at POD for 3 days or more\n#* *And* a scheduled custom export is generated with \"Stuck at POD\" selected\n#* *Then* the export should contain the number of days the load has been stuck at POD\n# *Vessel Data Integrity for Geofence-Triggered Events*\n#* *Given* a Vessel Arrival (VA) event is triggered via geofence at POD\n#* *When* the load status transitions occur\n#* *And* the Stuck at POD exception is calculated\n#* *Then* all mandatory vessel fields (vessel name, IMO, MMSI) should be properly populated in the sync message\n# *Unified Export Sync Validation*\n#* *Given* a load has Stuck at POD exception data\n#* *When* the data is synced to the Unified Export table\n#* *And* all mandatory fields are present\n#* *Then* the sync should complete successfully and data should be visible in scheduled exports\n# *Consistency Across All Export Mechanisms*\n#* *Given* Stuck at POD exception conditions are met\n#* *When* data is displayed in UI, scheduled exports, callbacks, or notifications\n#* *Then* all mechanisms should show consistent calculation and values\n# *Historical Data Validation*\n#* *Given* existing loads with Stuck at POD conditions that previously failed to sync\n#* *When* the fix is deployed\n#* *Then* a backfill or refresh mechanism should be available to correct historical data",

Despite the carrier sending ETA updates (AG events) with R4 segments containing delivery timestamps and UN/LOCODE information, the platform is failing to process and apply these ETAs to the final delivery stop.\n\n----\n\nh2. Business Impact\n\n* *Customer Concern:* ODL relies on accurate delivery ETAs to update their TMS systems\n* *Weekly follow-ups:* This is the customer's main concern in recurring meetings\n* *Trust Issue:* Customer is hesitant to use FourKites ETAs due to discrepancies between platform ETAs and carrier-provided ETAs\n* *Example Discrepancy:* Platform showing ETA of 16th vs. carrier indicating 18th-20th\n\n----\n\nh2. Technical Details\n\nh3. Root Cause Analysis Required\n\n*Issue 1: Address Matching Failure*\n\n* Carrier sends AG updates with UN/LOCODE {{USZLD}} (Zealand) for final delivery location\n* Platform attempts to match against Global Address Manager but fails\n* Error: \"Event alert address not found for the EPA ones\"\n* UN/LOCODE {{USZLD}} not found in either:\n** ODL's Address Manager\n** Global Address Manager\n\n*Issue 2: R4 Segment Not Processed*\n\n* EDI 315 files contain R4 segments with:\n** UN/LOCODEs for delivery locations\n** DTM timestamps for ETAs\n* R4 segment data is completely ignored in ETA calculation\n* This occurs even when other milestones are successfully processed\n\n*Issue 3: Place of Delivery (PoDL) Stop Issues*\n\n* Backend shows Place of Delivery stop (e.g., {{USBRO}} - Brownsville, Texas) created between POD and final delivery\n* PoDL stop is NOT visible in UI (possibly hidden by company settings)\n* Even when PoDL stop exists with matching UN/LOCODE in Global Address:\n** Stop type shows as \"Unknown\"\n** ETA from R4 segment not applied to PoDL\n** Delivery stop ETA not calculated based on PoDL ETA\n\n*Issue 4: Inconsistent Processing*\n\n* Some loads receive and display carrier ETA successfully\n* Others with similar structure fail to process\n* Need to identify difference between working and failing cases\n\n----\n\nh2. Examples Provided\n\nh3. Failing Case 1\n\n* *Load:* [Reference numbers differ in transcript]\n* *Carrier ETA:* 18th-20th (per carrier communication)\n* *Platform ETA:* 16th\n* *Issue:* Final delivery ETA not updating\n\nh3. Failing Case 2\n\n* *Final Delivery Location:* USZLD (Zealand)\n* *PoDL Location:* USBRO (Brownsville, Texas)\n* *Status:* USBRO exists in Global Address but ETA not applied\n\nh3. Working Case (Exception)\n\n* One example where carrier ETA was successfully processed and displayed\n* Need to identify why this case worked differently\n\n----\n\nh2. Current Operational Context\n\n* *Tracking Method:* Pure EDI 315 from C.H. Robinson (no RPA involved)\n* *Carrier Behavior:* C.H. Robinson only considers load-level ETA, not stop-level ETAs\n* *Stop Structure:* Loads contain intermediate PoDL stops between POD and final delivery\n* *Carrier Issue (Separate):* C.H. Robinson also unable to send POL ETA updates (operational challenge on their side)\n\n----\n\nh2. Investigation Requirements\n\nh3. Primary Questions to Answer\n\n# *Address Matching Logic:*\n#* Why does R4 segment check Global Address Manager instead of customer's Address Manager?\n#* Is this because PoDL feature is enabled?\n#* Can we force R4 segment to check Address Manager first?\n# *PoDL Stop Processing:*\n#* Why are PoDL stops hidden in UI?\n#* What controls PoDL visibility (company settings)?\n#* Why does stop type show as \"Unknown\" even when UN/LOCODE matches?\n#* What conditions prevent ETA application to existing PoDL stops?\n# *Delivery Stop Matching:*\n#* What are the exact conditions for creating/not creating PoDL stops?\n#* Currently doesn't create if same as POL or POD - does this check include delivery stop?\n#* Why isn't delivery stop ETA calculated from PoDL ETA when PoDL exists?\n# *Working vs. Failing Cases:*\n#* Identify differences between the one working case and multiple failing cases\n#* Could be timing-related (older vs. newer)?\n#* Could be data quality differences?\n\n----\n\nh2. Proposed Investigation Steps\n\n# *Debug EDI Processing Flow:*\n#* Trace complete path of EDI 315 AG update processing\n#* Identify exact point where address matching fails\n#* Document decision logic for Global Address vs. Address Manager lookup\n# *Analyze R4 Segment Handling:*\n#* Verify R4 segment parsing is working correctly\n#* Identify why R4 ETA data is not applied to any stop\n#* Check if R4 processing is dependent on address matching success\n# *Review PoDL Configuration:*\n#* Check ODL company settings for PoDL flags\n#* Identify UI visibility controls for PoDL stops\n#* Verify backend stop creation logic and type assignment\n# *Compare Working vs. Failing Cases:*\n#* Pull detailed logs for both scenarios\n#* Identify configuration or data differences\n#* Document conditions that allow successful processing\n\n----\n\nh2. Potential Solutions to Evaluate\n\nh3. Option 1: Address Manager Population\n\n* Add common C.H. Robinson UN/LOCODEs to ODL's Address Manager\n* Map to corresponding delivery locations\n* *Question:* Will this force R4 segment to check Address Manager?\n* *Concern:* May not solve root cause if logic still checks Global Address first\n\nh3. Option 2: Disable PoDL Feature (Similar to NextTracker)\n\n* NextTracker case: Disabled rail stops, allowed direct ETA application to delivery\n* Used city/country matching from RPA to associate with final delivery\n* *Question:* Will disabling PoDL for ODL force R4 segment ETAs to apply to delivery stops?\n* *Concern:* EDI 315 != RPA; different matching logic may be needed\n\nh3. Option 3: Fix R4 Segment Processing\n\n* Modify logic to always process R4 segment data regardless of address matching\n* Apply ETAs to appropriate stops based on stop sequence\n* Update both PoDL and delivery stop ETAs when R4 data available\n\nh3. Option 4: Enhanced Address Matching\n\n* Implement fallback matching logic:\n*# First check customer Address Manager\n*# Then check Global Address Manager\n*# Use fuzzy matching on city/state/country if UN/LOCODE fails\n* Ensure stop type correctly assigned when match found\n\n----\n\nh2. Success Criteria\n\n# \u2705 R4 segment ETA data from EDI 315 successfully processed\n# \u2705 Final delivery location receives carrier ETA updates\n# \u2705 Platform ETA matches carrier-communicated ETA (within reasonable tolerance)\n# \u2705 ETAs sync correctly to DWH for reporting\n# \u2705 Customer can reliably use FourKites ETAs in their TMS systems\n\n----\n\nh2. Timeline & Priority\n\n* *Customer Expectation:* Top priority resolution\n* *Weekly Customer Meetings:* Issue discussed in recurring calls with ODL + C.H. Robinson\n* *Next Customer Meeting:* TBD (weekly cadence)\n* *Target Resolution:* ASAP to maintain customer confidence\n\n----\n\nh2. Additional Context\n\nh3. Related Systems Impact\n\n* TMS integration depends on accurate ETAs\n* DWH syncing may be affected by incomplete stop state transitions\n* Reporting metrics (e.g., VD completeness) may be understated\n\nh3. Similar Historical Case\n\n* *NextTracker Issue:* Similar ETA application problem resolved by:\n** Disabling rail/PoDL stops\n** Using city/country matching from RPA\n** Backend changes to Get Shipments API\n** UI display updates\n* *Key Difference:* NextTracker used RPA; ODL uses EDI 315",

      "description": "Description:\n\nCurrently, the ds_kitebot_service exposes 7 endpoints.\n\nOut of these, 5 endpoints are directly used by the Disruption Dashboard. These five were jointly built by the Disruption and ISBU teams, were treated as high-priority, and are currently maintained by ISBU. The ISBU team is also already familiar with this codebase.\n\nThe remaining 2 endpoints (highlighted in green) are used by agent workflows and are not part of the Disruption Dashboard path.\n\nGiven this split, an initial lift-and-shift to Azure is a low-risk first step. If needed, we can migrate only the 5 Disruption-related endpoints and re-package them as a standalone service (e.g., disruption-service). This will allow us to progressively decouple Disruption from agent-specific dependencies, which we expect will be necessary long-term.\n\nDecision (from meeting on 12-01-2026):\n\nWe agreed to decouple the Disruption functionality from ds_kitebot_service and have ISBU own the Disruption services across both AWS and Azure.\n\nAsk:\n\nCreate and prioritize this work in Q1 to:\n\nSplit Disruption endpoints from agent-specific endpoints\n\nEstablish ISBU ownership for Disruption services\n\nEnable independent deployment and scaling in AWS and Azure\n\n!image-20260112-120842.png|width=674,alt=\"image-20260112-120842.png\"!\n\n\n\n[~accountid:712020:e0c71a6b-05c6-4f69-b96d-45475c61fbc9] [~accountid:608f818cf6c0960069a011e0] [~accountid:5e84add7dde1d50c1df0e3f6] ",

Could see each BOL had been marked as delivered. I then checked the JT subscription for each load and although MSDU2764991 and TGBU3052317 started out with REFERENCE_NOT_FOUND messages, they would later have successful crawl attempts.\n\nI then checked the location details for each load and can see we're still processing location updates for the assigned vessels and the POL and POD geofences were both missed on each load.\n\nLogs Link / Logs attached: [^log_data - 2026-01-08T160719.039.csv] [^log_data - 2026-01-08T161838.069.csv] [^log_data - 2026-01-08T161802.872.csv] [^log_data - 2026-01-08T161654.673.csv] [^log_data - 2026-01-08T161333.588.csv] [^log_data - 2026-01-08T161256.852.csv] [^log_data - 2026-01-08T160837.423.csv] \n\nLog Query and Time frame: multimodal-carrier-updates-worker and global-worker for the last 3 days. With global-worker, I filtered to use the message_type of POST_LOCATION_UPDATE\n\nSuper API Response: \n\nInitial RCA:This doesn\u2019t appear to be expected behavior. The loads are delivered within the carrier\u2019s website, but we\u2019re still tracking the containers. The containers weren\u2019t detected within the POL or POD geofences either. \n\nScreenshots: \n\n!Screen Shot 2026-01-08 at 4.17.54 PM.png|width=686,alt=\"Screen Shot 2026-01-08 at 4.17.54 PM.png\"!\n\n!Screen Shot 2026-01-08 at 4.12.45 PM.png|width=686,alt=\"Screen Shot 2026-01-08 at 4.12.45 PM.png\"!\n\n!Screen Shot 2026-01-08 at 4.16.45 PM.png|width=686,alt=\"Screen Shot 2026-01-08 at 4.16.45 PM.png\"!\n\n!Screen Shot 2026-01-08 at 4.13.26 PM.png|width=686,alt=\"Screen Shot 2026-01-08 at 4.13.26 PM.png\"!\n\n!Screen Shot 2026-01-08 at 4.14.59 PM.png|width=686,alt=\"Screen Shot 2026-01-08 at 4.14.59 PM.png\"!\n\n!Screen Shot 2026-01-08 at 4.18.31 PM.png|width=686,alt=\"Screen Shot 2026-01-08 at 4.18.31 PM.png\"!\n\n!Screen Shot 2026-01-08 at 1.21.18 PM.png|width=686,alt=\"Screen Shot 2026-01-08 at 1.21.18 PM.png\"!\n\n!Screen Shot 2026-01-08 at 1.35.17 PM.png|width=686,alt=\"Screen Shot 2026-01-08 at 1.35.17 PM.png\"!\n\n!Screen Shot 2026-01-08 at 1.32.32 PM.png|width=686,alt=\"Screen Shot 2026-01-08 at 1.32.32 PM.png\"!\n\n!Screen Shot 2026-01-08 at 1.31.26 PM.png|width=686,alt=\"Screen Shot 2026-01-08 at 1.31.26 PM.png\"!\n\n!Screen Shot 2026-01-08 at 1.31.12 PM.png|width=686,alt=\"Screen Shot 2026-01-08 at 1.31.12 PM.png\"!\n\n!Screen Shot 2026-01-08 at 1.29.33 PM.png|width=686,alt=\"Screen Shot 2026-01-08 at 1.29.33 PM.png\"!\n\n!Screen Shot 2026-01-08 at 1.29.04 PM.png|width=686,alt=\"Screen Shot 2026-01-08 at 1.29.04 PM.png\"!\n\n!Screen Shot 2026-01-08 at 1.28.36 PM.png|width=686,alt=\"Screen Shot 2026-01-08 at 1.28.36 PM.png\"!\n\n!Screen Shot 2026-01-08 at 1.23.14 PM.png|width=686,alt=\"Screen Shot 2026-01-08 at 1.23.14 PM.png\"!\n\n!Screen Shot 2026-01-08 at 1.23.00 PM.png|width=686,alt=\"Screen Shot 2026-01-08 at 1.23.00 PM.png\"!\n\n!Screen Shot 2026-01-08 at 1.22.38 PM.png|width=686,alt=\"Screen Shot 2026-01-08 at 1.22.38 PM.png\"!\n\n!Screen Shot 2026-01-08 at 1.22.27 PM.png|width=686,alt=\"Screen Shot 2026-01-08 at 1.22.27 PM.png\"!\n\n!Screen Shot 2026-01-08 at 1.21.48 PM.png|width=686,alt=\"Screen Shot 2026-01-08 at 1.21.48 PM.png\"!\n\n\n\nReferred Docs / Confluence links / Jira Tickets / Runbooks:\n\nExpected Result: Loads should have been marked as delivered and not displaying any additional ETA to POD.\n\nActual Result: Loads are still active and displaying ETA to POD.",

When checking the milestone updates, we have not received any ATD event for pickup. Only Empty Equipment Dispatched has been received. In the logs, no trace for the ATD timestamp. Need to check from where the ATD has been retrieved and updated to the stop. Even the ATD logic of 48 hours is also not matching with the ATD timestamp.\n\nTHis is happening because of Substitution logic.

It has departed from Zeebrugge and yet to arrive at Hamburg. The carrier events only screen is showing below events:\n\n# Estimate Arrival at Hamburg with vessel \u201cCMA CGM JACQUES JOSEPH\u201d reported on {{2025-12-19}}\n# Estimate Discharge at Hamburg with vessel \u201cACHELOOS\u201d reported on {{2026-01-02}}\n\nI guess the problem is that initially carrier has given estimated arrival with one vessel and later gave only estimated discharge with new vessel without any estimated arrival. Since both events are unique in nature, we are still showing both events which is not logical and the data is also stale.

      "description": "h2. Background\n\nRelated to [MM-13047|https://fourkites.atlassian.net/browse/MM-13047] - During investigation of booking CAN7410804, we discovered that DSV API returns responses with an empty {{containers}} field ({{\"containers\": []}}).\n\nh2. Problem Statement\n\nAccording to the DSV API specification, the {{containers}} field should not be blank. However, DSV is returning responses where this field is empty. Our current parser logic:\n\n# Expects container numbers to be present under {{containers/containerNumber}}\n# Ties events to each container number listed\n# Skips parsing entirely when {{containers}} is empty, resulting in *no events being processed*\n\nThis causes loads to remain untracked even when DSV has shipment data available.\n\nh2. Current Behavior\n\nWhen DSV returns an empty {{containers}} array:\n\n* Parser does not process any events\n* Load shows error: {{\"Empty CARRIER API response for DSV Ocean\"}}\n* No tracking data is applied to the load\n\nh2. Expected Behavior\n\nParser should handle the edge case of empty {{containers}} field gracefully. Options to consider:\n\n# *Apply events at shipment level* - If containers are empty, apply events to the shipment/booking without container-level granularity\n# *Extract container from event data* - Some events contain container numbers in {{eventTypeValue}}; these could be extracted\n# *Log and alert* - Log the anomaly for monitoring while still processing available data\n\nh2. DSV API Spec Reference\n\n* Spec Doc: [DSV Ocean API Spec|https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SJ4Eq9XIgKnVBwIISBLxhYrpbbLEDpoE9vu5bY_W6RQ/edit?tab=t.0]\n* Key rules from spec:\n** Query using House Bill Number / FF Booking Number / Container Number\n** Pick container numbers from {{containers/containerNumber}}\n** If multiple containers: events apply to all\n** If container mentioned in event ({{eventTypeValue}}): tie to that specific container only\n\nh2. Sample DSV Response (CAN7410804)\n\n{code:json}{\n    \"shipmentId\": \"SCAN7410804\",\n    \"status\": \"COMPLETED\",\n    \"containers\": [],  // <-- Empty array causing the issue\n    ...\n}{code}\n\nh2.

      "summary": "Apply UI Fallback Logic for Stop Arrival Time in Ocean Export Reports",
      "description": "h1. User Story\n\nh2. Description\n\n*As a* supply chain operations manager reviewing ocean shipments in bulk via exports,  \n*I want* the {{ARRIVED_AT_PORT_OF_DISCHARGE}} column to consistently populate with arrival timestamps using the same fallback logic as the UI,  \n*So that* I can perform mass reviews and KPI calculations without manual validation of missing data.\n\nh3. Problem Context\n\nCurrently, there is an inconsistency between the UI and Export behavior for POD arrival times:\n\n* *UI Behavior*: When \"Vessel Arrival\" event is missing, the UI uses \"Unloaded from Vessel\" event timestamp as a fallback and displays it as ATA for POD\n* *Export Behavior*: Export strictly looks for \"Vessel Arrival\" event only, leaving the {{ARRIVED_AT_PORT_OF_DISCHARGE}} column blank when this event is missing, even though \"Unloaded from Vessel\" data exists\n\nThis discrepancy creates operational challenges for customers who rely on exports for bulk reviews, as blank fields are incorrectly interpreted as shipments not having arrived yet.\n\nh3. Customer Impact\n\n*Customer*: SC Johnson (Dollarcity)  \n*Salesforce Case*: [02672025|https://fourkites.lightning.force.com/lightning/r/Case/500Ps000016aArJIAU/view]  \n*Related Query Ticket*: MM-13137\n\nCustomer feedback: _\"Part of our team reviews arrival times in bulk using the exported reports, not directly in the platform. When this field is empty in the report, we interpret it as the shipment not having arrived yet, which leads to incorrect conclusions and additional manual validation. Since the platform already infers arrival time from the 'Unloaded from Vessel' event when the 'Vessel Arrival' event is missing, the report should apply the same fallback logic.\"_\n\n----\n\nh2. Acceptance Criteria\n\nh3. 1. *Export Logic Mirrors UI Logic*\n\n* *Given* a shipment has \"Unloaded from Vessel\" event but no \"Vessel Arrival\" event for POD\n* *When* the shipment data is exported via ocean shipment reports\n* *Then* the {{ARRIVED_AT_PORT_OF_DISCHARGE}} column should be populated with the \"Unloaded from Vessel\" event timestamp\n\nh3. 2. *Consistent Behavior Across Export Types*\n\n* *Given* the export fallback logic is implemented\n* *When* exports are generated via scheduled reports, ad-hoc exports, or API endpoints\n* *Then* all export types should apply the same fallback logic consistently\n\nh3. 3. *No Impact on Existing Vessel Arrival Events*\n\n* *Given* a shipment has an actual \"Vessel Arrival\" event for POD\n* *When* the shipment data is exported\n* *Then* the {{ARRIVED_AT_PORT_OF_DISCHARGE}} column should continue to use the \"Vessel Arrival\" timestamp (no change from current behavior)\n\nh3. 4. *Backward Compatibility*\n\n* *Given* the export logic change is deployed\n* *When* existing customer exports are regenerated\n* *Then* previously blank {{ARRIVED_AT_PORT_OF_DISCHARGE}} fields should now be populated with fallback timestamps where applicable\n\n----\n\nh2. Functional Testing Scenarios\n\n* *Scenario 1*: Verify export populates POD arrival when only \"Unloaded from Vessel\" exists\n** Test shipments: CO20251018, CO20251019 (from MM-13137)\n** Verify {{ARRIVED_AT_PORT_OF_DISCHARGE}} matches UI display\n* *Scenario 2*: Verify \"Vessel Arrival\" event takes precedence over \"Unloaded from Vessel\"\n** Test with shipments that have both events\n** Confirm \"Vessel Arrival\" timestamp is used\n* *Scenario 3*: Verify exports remain blank when neither event exists\n** Test with shipments missing both \"Vessel Arrival\" and \"Unloaded from Vessel\"\n** Confirm field remains empty as expected\n\n----\n\nh2. Technical Implementation Notes\n\nh3. Current Implementation Gap\n\n* Export Service queries only for \"Vessel Arrival\" (VA) event code\n* UI applies fallback logic: uses \"Unloaded from Vessel\" (UV) event when VA is missing\n* Export logic needs to be updated to match UI's fallback behavior\n\nh3. Proposed Solution\n\n# Update Export Service to check for \"Vessel Arrival\" event first\n# If \"Vessel Arrival\" is missing, fallback to \"Unloaded from Vessel\" event timestamp\n# Apply this logic consistently across all ocean export endpoints\n# Ensure no performance degradation (queries should be optimized)\n\nh3. Components Affected\n\n* Ocean Export Service\n* Export data mapping/transformation layer\n* Any scheduled report generation logic\n\nh3. Data Validation\n\n* Verify no regressions for shipments with \"Vessel Arrival\" events\n* Validate timestamp accuracy for fallback scenarios\n* Test export generation performance (ensure no slowdown)\n\n----\n\nh2. Communication & Rollout Plan\n\nh3. Customer Communication\n\n* Frame as bug fix: \"Correcting inconsistency where exports didn't match UI logic\"\n* Release note: \"Export reports now consistently populate POD arrival times using vessel unload data when vessel arrival events are unavailable\"\n* Proactively notify SC Johnson and other customers using ocean exports\n\nh3. Rollout Approach\n\n* Deploy to staging environment first\n* Validate with sample exports from affected customers\n* Monitor support tickets for any unexpected feedback post-deployment\n\n----\n\nh2. Future Enhancement Vision\n\nh3. Phase 2: \"Carrier Data Only vs. All Data\" Configuration\n\nThis fix addresses an immediate gap, but it highlights a broader product opportunity:\n\n*Concept*: Introduce an export configuration toggle that allows customers to choose between:\n\n# *\"Carrier Data Only\"* - Export only raw carrier events without FourKites intelligence layer\n# *\"All Data (with FourKites Intelligence)\"* - Export includes FourKites inferred/derived milestones\n\n*Benefits*:\n\n* \u2705 Provides transparency for customers who want to distinguish carrier-provided vs. FourKites-inferred data\n* \u2705 Addresses multiple scenarios beyond just vessel arrival (inferred pickup/delivery, estimated timestamps, AI/ML-enhanced data)\n* \u2705 Reduces future config proliferation - one toggle handles many cases\n* \u2705 Positions FourKites intelligence as a valuable feature customers can control\n\n*Applicable Use Cases*:\n\n* Vessel arrival fallback (current case)\n* Inferred pickup/delivery milestones\n* Estimated timestamps where actuals are missing\n* Any future AI-enhanced data points\n\n*Implementation Considerations*:\n\n* Add export-level configuration setting (not per-field)\n* Consider whether this applies to all export templates or is selectable per template\n* Document all milestones/fields that include FourKites intelligence\n* Ensure clear customer communication about the difference between modes\n\n*Timeline*: Target for Q2 2025 as a strategic product capability\n\n----\n\nh2. Definition of Done\n\n* Code implemented according to specifications\n* Unit tests written and passing for fallback logic scenarios\n* Integration tests passing for all export types\n* Documentation updated (export field definitions, API specs)\n* Feature validated in staging environment with sample customer data\n* QA verification completed for all acceptance criteria\n* Product Manager approval obtained\n* Release notes prepared for customer communication\n* Support team informed of the change\n\n----\n\nh2. Dependencies\n\n* *Linked Work Item*: MM-13137 (Query ticket - customer reported issue)\n** Use \"is caused by\" link from this story to the query ticket\n** Status: Resolved (pending this implementation)\n\n----\n\nh2. Additional Context\n\nh3. RCA Summary (from MM-13137)\n\n* Root cause: Export logic only checks for \"Vessel Arrival\" event code\n* UI successfully derives POD ATA from \"Unloaded from Vessel\" when VA is missing\n* Export service is not configured to apply the same fallback/mapping logic\n\nh3. Customer Operational Context\n\n* SC Johnson team performs bulk reviews using exported reports\n* They rely on blank fields to indicate missing data/events\n* Current blank fields mislead them to think shipments haven't arrived when they actually have\n* This creates unnecessary manual validation work and potential KPI calculation errors\n\nh3. Data Validation Results\n\n* Sample loads analyzed: CO20251018, CO20251019\n* Confirmed UI shows POD ATA populated\n* Confirmed exports show {{ARRIVED_AT_PORT_OF_DISCHARGE}} as blank\n* Verified \"Unloaded from Vessel\" event exists in backend data\n\n----\n\n*Story Points*: _To be estimated by engineering team_  \n*Sprint*: _To be assigned during sprint planning_  \n*Priority*: P2 (Customer escalation, operational impact)",

As part of this, they will be closely reviewing service performance before making a final subscription decision. The issue outlined below has raised concerns on data reliability.Issue Summary\nFor the above shipment (and several others), *Vessel Departure (VD)* was marked via an *inferred event* _before_ the vessel was actually loaded.\n\n* The *inferred VD* was marked on *12/02*\n* The *actual ERPA update* with VD was received later on *12/04*, after vessel loading\n* As a result, the customer sees VD occurring before the load event, which appears unrealistic and confusing\n\nAdditionally:\n\n* The inferred *Vessel Arrival (VA)* and *Vessel Departure (VD)* show a gap of only ~2 hours at port\n* LDC has questioned how a vessel can arrive and depart within such a short window, especially before loading is completed\n* This behavior has been observed across multiple shipments\n\nOne consistent pattern across the affected shipments:\n\n* All loads were *created on 12/23*\n* However, the *actual sailing dates were on or before 12/02*\n\nThis suggests that the system may be inferring VA/VD events retrospectively for historical sailings, possibly due to *late load creation (LLC)*. We need confirmation on whether this is the expected behavior and if LLC is the root cause.Customer Impact\n\n* Data appears unrealistic and inconsistent with actual vessel operations\n* Loss of confidence in inferred events and milestone accuracy\n* Risk to pilot success and final subscription decision\n\nAsk / Next Steps\n\n# Can you confirm whether *late load creation (LLC)* is causing these inferred VA/VD events to be backfilled incorrectly?\n# Is there a way to *suppress or adjust inferred VA/VD* when the sailing has already occurred before load creation?\n# What is the recommended *long-term fix* to prevent inferred VD being marked before actual vessel loading?\n# Guidance on *customer-facing explanation* would be helpful before we respond to LDC.\n\nAffected Shipments\n*Evergreen*\n\n* 159500040475\n* 159500036762\n* 159500048417\n* 159500048719\n* 159500048701\n* 159500048182\n* 159500040492\n* 159500042028\n\n*MSC*\n\n* 177WATATQ1998RF\n\n*ONE*\n\n* ONEYTAOFL2320900\n* ONEYTAOFL6937600\n* ONEYTAOFL5237500\n* ONEYTAOFL9184300\n* ONEYTAOFL5250700\n* ONEYTAOFK4728800\n* ONEYTAOFL6262400\n* TA5VYF673400\n* TA5DKM940800\n\nPlease let us know your findings and recommended next steps so we can respond to the customer with clarity and confidence.\n\n!Screenshot 2025-12-29 at 7.51.21\u202fAM.png|width=686,alt=\"Screenshot 2025-12-29 at 7.51.21\u202fAM.png\"!",
