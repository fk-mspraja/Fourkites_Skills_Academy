# Response to Arpit

**Message:**

You're absolutely right - I should have connected with the team first to understand expectations before diving into the gap analysis. I took a bottom-up approach (codebase → findings → recommendations) when I should have started with understanding the strategic vision.

For context: I'm working on a proposal for layered AI architecture and reusable skills library framework. This Cassie analysis was meant as a practical example of rapid improvement at minimal time investment, but I should have validated the approach with the team first.

I've sent the doc to Sudhanshu and he's reviewing it. I've also added a preface clarifying this was done independently without team alignment, so they know to treat it as preliminary observations.

**Next Steps:**
1. Scheduling sync with Goutham/Ashish/Sudhanshu this week to understand:
   - Cassie's intended scope and architecture vision
   - Expected role of MCPs in the diagnostic flow
   - Phase 1 success criteria and priorities
   - Which patterns should be automated first

2. Will revise the analysis after getting that context and team feedback

Thanks for the course correction - lesson learned on doing discovery before deep dives.
