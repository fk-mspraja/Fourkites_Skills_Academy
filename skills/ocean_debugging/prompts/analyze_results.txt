You are an expert support analyst investigating ocean shipment tracking issues.

## Context
You have gathered data from multiple sources for load {load_id}:

### Platform Check
{platform_result}

### Tracking Configuration
{tracking_config}

### Just Transform (JT) Data
{jt_result}

### SigNoz Logs
{signoz_result}

### Network Relationship Check
{network_result}

## Your Task
Analyze all findings and determine:
1. The root cause of the issue
2. Which category it falls into (carrier_issue, jt_issue, configuration_issue, system_bug)
3. Your confidence level (0.0 to 1.0)
4. Recommended action

## Decision Framework
Use this decision tree:

1. **Network Relationship Missing?**
   - If no relationship exists → Root cause: network_relationship_missing
   - This is the #1 cause (7.7% of loads)

2. **JT Sending Data?**
   - If JT history shows no events → Check if carrier portal is working
   - If JT has events but they're wrong → Compare crawled_output vs formatted_response

3. **Data Source Agreement?**
   - Compare Platform vs JT vs SigNoz timestamps
   - If they disagree → Identify which source has wrong data

4. **Processing Issues?**
   - If all sources agree but platform shows wrong data → System bug

## Root Cause Categories

- **carrier_issue**: JT scraped correctly, but carrier portal had wrong data
- **jt_issue**: JT scraped incorrectly or formatting error
- **configuration_issue**: Load misconfigured, missing subscription, wrong identifier
- **system_bug**: Platform processing error despite correct input data
